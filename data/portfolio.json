I decided to describe the event so that people could understand what happened and minimize the fact that it had a silly name. \"Ice Cream, Beside a roaring fireplace\" is more attractive and makes more sense.",

I am very happy with this design. The lady is excited, and human faces draw the viewer's attention like a magnet, especially when the faces are looking at important information. Second, the text on a slant looks very spiffy. Slab serif seals the deal.",

			"year": "2009",
			"description": "Unlike many other Tech House publications, this design was whipped up to be passed around in the evening during A Day on College Hill. Prospective freshmen were welcomed to attend our Stuff Night, so the target audience was a 17-year-old who may not even know about Tech House, but was making plans for that evening. Also, the viewer would be on the receiving end of a face-to-face pitch from a Tech House member that described the event. This drove some design decisions:  the overall goal of the flyer was to remind the recipient of the conversation, not introduce it anew. I also wanted to include a large version of our cool logo and give them the means to find the building. Lesson learned:  find out if your materials are going to be viewed in low-light situations and increase the content size or paper size accordingly.",

			"description": "This series of tableslip designs continued the polished, sophisticated design theme for Tech House publications. Column layouts are great, and this one works well with elegant serif type and the flourish for balance. This tableslip was the first design to include double-sided printing, which gave the front more room without a map wedged into a corner, and the back had a large, gorgeous map with destination callout. The inclusion of a readable, helpful map was important because publication corresponded to the first public event of the school year, so the target audience was the new student that didn't know where Tech House was located. A new challenge involved letting the audience know that there was a back side to the printing. To do so, I included the notice in the lower right area, in case the tableslip landed face-up, and used light background colors on the front so the high-contrast map would show through given the slightest bit of backlight when the slip is lifted from the table.",

The font I chose is really groovy and Unicode-tastic, the background is pretty high-energy, and the silhouettes are excited and good-looking. It's a shame that we didn't have color printing available, because the background started out as a hot red blast.",

This was a group project that unfolded in a few short hours inside Tech House Black Ops, right up against the deadline. The site consisted of twenty-three pages, but cunning use of PHP, CSS, XML and XSLT made short work of this challenge.",
