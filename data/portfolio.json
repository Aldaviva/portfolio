		"description": "Unlike many other Tech House publications, this design was whipped up to be passed around in the evening during A Day on College Hill. Prospective freshmen were welcomed to attend our Stuff Night, so the target audience was a 17-year-old who may not even know about Tech House, but was making plans for that evening. Also, the viewer would be on the receiving end of a face-to-face pitch from a Tech House member that described the event. This drove some design decisions:  the overall goal of the flyer was to remind the recipient of the conversation, not introduce it anew. I also wanted to include a large version of our cool logo and give them the means to find the building. Lesson learned:  find out if your materials are going to be viewed in low-light situations and increase the content size or paper size accordingly.",

		"description": "This series of tableslip designs continued the polished, sophisticated design theme for Tech House publications. Column layouts are great, and this one works well with elegant serif type and the flourish for balance. This tableslip was the first design to include double-sided printing, which gave the front more room without a map wedged into a corner, and the back had a large, gorgeous map with destination callout. The inclusion of a readable, helpful map was important because publication corresponded to the first public event of the school year, so the target audience was the new student that didn't know where Tech House was located. A new challenge involved letting the audience know that there was a back side to the printing. To do so, I included the notice in the lower right area, in case the tableslip landed face-up, and used light background colors on the front so the high-contrast map would show through given the slightest bit of backlight when the slip is lifted from the table.",
